# Homogenization data and fitting coefficients for lattice combinations

This repository contains the homogenization data and fitted surrogate model coefficients for lattice structures.

## Dataset Overview

The original homogenization data is stored in `hybrid-lattice-database`

The fitting coefficients are stored in a single JSON file:  `LatticeData.json`
